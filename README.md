## Why?

> There are lots of differing browsers and browser versions in use throughout the world, each one has a slightly different set of features to the rest. This can make developing for browsers a difficult task. The latest versions of the popular browsers can do lots of things which older browsers can not â€“ but you may still have to support the older browsers. Polyfill.io makes it simpler to support differing browsers by attempting to recreate the missing features with polyfills: You can make use of the latest and greatest features in browsers which support them, and in those that do not.
